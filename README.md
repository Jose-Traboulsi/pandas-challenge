# pandas-challenge

All code is my own, and was produced by following the steps suggested throughout the sheet and leveraging class materials. Building on the experience gained from thep prior module's challenge, you'll see I used f-string and "\n\n" code to print results in a cleaner manner. I also formatted some numbers for improved legibility. Please see attached Word doc with analysis.
